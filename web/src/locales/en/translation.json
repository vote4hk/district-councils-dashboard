In the past, there had been an unwritten requirement that the Government would not bring before the Legislative Council on a policy opposed by the District Council, but this was not necessarily the case. However, in some areas, such as bus routes and road planning, the views of District Councils can still influence decision-making.",

  "about.paragraph5": "Among the 1,200 members of the Chief Executive Election Committee, 117 are elected by the District Councils of Hong Kong and Kowloon (57 members) and the New Territories District Councils (60 members). It is worth noting that as Hong Kong's political camps are broadly divided into formed and pan-democratic groups, as has been the case, these Election Committee seats will be taken by more than half the District Council camps.",
